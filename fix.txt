weird:

velocity exceeds max_v??

high priority:

lower margin of error, currently it is too high
 - ball is 5 cm away from setpoint, but "accuracy" is still >0.9
rewards centered at 0, go + or -
 - not sure if this is actually better than normalized tho
instead of exp function to increase penalty, use rate of change of distance
 - exp is arbitrary and should still work fine, but d(distance)/dx sounds more practical and robust
 - not that this will fix everything, just an optimization that is good to have


low priority:

merge train and test files -> input("Train (1) or Test (2)?")
 - passes same kwargs in both files
 - cleanest way is to make a class. this would reduce repeated code and can also help with ui stuff
make Pause button have an updating timer
 - cant use time.sleep then, have to use some other way to pause testing loop code
 - "# starting a 'blocking' loop to let the user interact fig.canvas.start_event_loop(timeout=-1)"
when screenshotting with button, dont include the button in output image

notes:

about "limiting possible angles in action space"
 - tried this, gets stuck in loop because the model itself is dumb and false circular logic for why it should work like this
 - can just set the angle to (max_ang_a)^-1 instead of max_a
