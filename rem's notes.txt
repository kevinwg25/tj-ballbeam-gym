OA = original author (of repo)

to do:
- motor physical limitation
    - in update() of ballbeam.py, OA made note that "simulation could be improved further by using voltage as input and a motor simulation deciding theta"
    - insead of angular acceleration, more accurate to use torque
    - talk to dean about stepper motor from robolab (its a rotary encoder used in 3d printers, very good)
- in base.py, since bb = BallBeam object hasn't yet been created, the random initial_velocity range is different from reset() when initializing. not a big problem, but it is something that culd be fixed
- instead of having a bool for random init vel, just make it always do that since its basic robustness
    - only reason not to do it is to train something faster for reward function configuration
- check that setpoint is updated

can someone explain why "setting actor output action_std to :  0.4" thing is necessary
